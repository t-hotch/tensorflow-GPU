# Containerized TensorFlow GPU development environment

A containerized TensorFlow AI/ML development environment with NVIDIA GPU support. This repository provides a consistent development environment using VS Code Dev Containers, eliminating the need for manual environment setup.

The underlying docker container is based on NVIDIA's TensorFlow 24.06 container. For details see:

- George's TensorFlow 2.16 container on DockerHub: [gperdrizet/tensorflow-gpu](https://hub.docker.com/r/gperdrizet/tensorflow-gpu)
- NVIDIA's [TensorFlow Release 24.06](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/frameworks/tensorflow-release-notes/rel-24-06.html)

The container needs Docker and a compatible NVIDIA driver installed. It should support GPUs back to Pascal on both Windows and Linux (MacOS users should be able to run it without GPU support - see below). 

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this development container, you need to install:

1. **NVIDIA driver >=545** (slightly older drivers may work - try it before you make major changes to your host system)
2. **Docker** (see platform-specific instructions below)
2. **Visual Studio Code** - [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com)
3. **Dev Containers extension** - Install from the VS Code Extensions marketplace (`ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`)

## Docker installation instructions

### Windows

Full installation documentation here: [Install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install)

1. **Check system requirements**
   - Windows 10 64-bit: Pro, Enterprise, or Education (Build 19041 or higher), or Windows 11
   - Windows 11 64-bit: Enterprise, Pro, or Education version 23H2 (build 22631) or higher
   - WSL 2.1.5 or later
   - 64-bit processor with Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)
   - 4GB system RAM
   - Enable hardware virtualization in BIOS/UEFI. For more information, see Virtualization.

2. **Install or update WSL**

    Full documentation here: [WSL: Verification and setup](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install#wsl-verification-and-setup)

    - To check your WSL version, open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

    ```powershell
    wsl --version
    ```

    - Then install or update as needed:

    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```

    ```powershell
    wsl --update
    ```
   - Restart your computer when prompted

3. **Download and install Docker Desktop**
   - Download Docker Desktop from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
   - Run the installer and follow the prompts
   - Ensure "Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V" is selected during installation

4. **Start Docker Desktop**
   - Launch Docker Desktop from the Start menu
   - Wait for Docker to fully start (the whale icon in the system tray will stop animating)

5. **Verify installation**
   - Open a terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt) and run:
     ```powershell
     docker --version
     ```

    The command should complete without error.

> **Note for GPU support:** To use GPU acceleration on Windows, you'll need an NVIDIA GPU with updated drivers.

---

### Linux

For Linux set-up instructions, refer to [Install Docker Desktop on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux).

> **Note for GPU support:** To use GPU acceleration on Linux, you'll need an NVIDIA GPU with updated drivers and the [NVIDIA container toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html).

### MacOS

Apple dropped NVIDIA support around 2014, but you can still use this container to run TensorFlow on CPU only. See full docker setup documentation here: [Install Docker Desktop on Mac](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install)

1. **Check system requirements**
   - MacOS 14 (Sonoma) or newer
   - At least 4 GB of RAM

2. **Download Docker Desktop**
   - Download the appropriate version:
     - **Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3):** Download "Docker Desktop for Mac with Apple silicon"
     - **Intel Mac:** Download "Docker Desktop for Mac with Intel chip"

3. **Install Docker Desktop**
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
   - Drag the Docker icon to the Applications folder
   - Launch Docker from the Applications folder
   - Select 'Use recommended settings'
   - Grant any permissions requested during first launch

4. **Start Docker Desktop**
   - Click the Docker icon in the Applications folder
   - Wait for Docker to fully start (check the whale icon in the menu bar)

5. **Verify installation**
   - Open Terminal and run:
     ```bash
     docker --version
     ```

    The command should complete without error.

> **Note:** Current Apple hardware does not use NVIDIA GPUs. Using this setup, TensorFlow will run in CPU only mode on MacOS. If you are feeling brave, you can run TensorFlow on Apple Silicon GPUs - see here: [Get started with tensorflow-metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/tensorflow-plugin). But that's a whole other ball of wax...

## Getting started

Once you have a current NVIDIA driver (>=545) and Docker with GPU support. Starting a CUDA/TensorFlow development envronment from this repository is easy. Use it like a template to start new projects:

1. **Fork this repository** to create your own copy:
   - Click the **"Fork"** button in the top-right corner of this repository's GitHub page
   - Select your GitHub account as the destination
   - This creates your own copy where you can save your work and push changes

2. **Clone your forked repository:**

   On your local machine run:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tensorflow-GPU.git
   cd tensorflow-GPU
   ```
   > Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username

4. **Open the folder in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

5. **Launch the dev container:**
   - When prompted, click **"Reopen in Container"**
   - Or press `F1` → Type "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" → Press Enter

6. **Wait for the container to build** (this may take a few minutes on first run)

7. **Start coding!** Open and run `notebooks/test.ipynb` to verify your environment is working.

### Keeping Your Fork Updated

To sync your fork with the latest changes from this original repository:

```bash
# Add the original repo as an upstream remote (only needed once)
git remote add upstream https://github.com/gperdrizet/tensorflow-GPU.git

# Fetch and merge updates
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/main
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Docker not starting:** Ensure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS settings
- **Permission denied errors on Linux:** Make sure you've added your user to the docker group and logged out/in
- **GPU not detected:** Verify NVIDIA drivers and Container Toolkit (if needed) are properly installed
- **Container build fails:** Ensure you have a stable internet connection for downloading the TensorFlow image
